# SampleGame
Created a game using DirectX SDK and Visual Studio 2017.
- Game was programmed using C++ language.
- This is a two player game.
- Power ups are scattered randomly with rocks in the way to make it difficult to get to the power up and gives you a place to hide in case opponent starts attacking. 

Objective of this game is to collect as many power ups(HP Boost, Special Attack) before confronting your opponent. 
- Players start off with 200 hp and simple attacks that deal 10 damage to HP. The simple attacks can also destroy a rock.
- HP Powerup increases HP by 100.
- Special attack power up allows player to gain 3x increase in speed. The speed boost will stay until user uses their special attack.
- Special attack can deal 100 damage to HP and destroys all rocks in it's path.

- Special attack is 3 times the size of normal attack and 10 times the damage.

Best method to win the fight is by collecting as many power ups as possible, using the speed to constantly deal damage until opponent is a 1 hit to the special attack and the rocks are no longer in the way when you're moving. Then use the special attack when you're close enough to your enemy so that it doesnt miss.
